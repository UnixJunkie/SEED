      NOTE    = "Beta3s was modelled by explicitly considering
all heavy atoms and the hydrogen atoms bound to nitrogen or oxygen
atoms ${\cite{Brooks:CHARMM}}$. The aqueous solvent was approximated
by an implicit model based on the solvent accessible 
surface (atomic solvation parameters of 
0.012 kcal/mol{\AA}$^{2}$ for carbon atoms, and
$-$0.060 kcal/mol{\AA}$^{2}$ for nitrogen and oxygen atoms 
${\cite{Fraternali:Anefficient}}$).
Ionic side chains were neutralized ${\cite{Lazaridis:New}}$ and a linear 
distance-dependent dielectric function ($\epsilon(r)=2r$) 
was used for the electrostatic interactions.  
The CHARMM PARAM19 default cutoffs for long range interactions were used,
i.e., a shift function ${\cite{Brooks:CHARMM}}$ was employed with a cutoff
at 7.5 \AA\ for both the electrostatic and van der Waals terms.
This cutoff length was chosen to be consistent with the parametrization
of the force-field.
The nonbonded interactions were updated every 10 dynamics steps.
Constant temperature MD simulations were performed with a 
coupling constant of 5 ps ${\cite{Berendsen:Molecular}}$.  
The SHAKE algorithm was used to fix the length of the
covalent bonds where hydrogen atoms are involved, which allows an 
integration time step of 2 fs. Coordinate frames were saved every 10 ps.
