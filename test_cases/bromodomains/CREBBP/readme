Test case with multiple CREBBP inhibitors and target pdb structure 5mqk.
In seed.inp, the 13 points for reduction of polar and apolar vectors (i.e., for defining the binding site) 
are the coordinates of the 5mqk ligand (3-acetylindole). 

Four of the CREBBP ligands are described in the paper by Spiliotopoulos et al., 
Virtual screen to NMR (VS2NMR): Discovery of fragment hits for the CBP bromodomain
Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 27, 2472, 2017.

For the ligand 5mgj_baz2 there are also X-ray structures in BAZ2A and BAZ2B.

For 5mqg there are two different poses in the two proteins of the asymmetric unit.
Thus, xr_5mqg_a and xr_5mqg_b are the binding modes in bromodomain chain A and B, respectively.

Note that DElec is very unfavorable only for the compound with a formal charge (negatively charged carboxy).
Thus, DElec should not be used for ranking charged compounds.
